Retrospective Notes:

Week 1: 
What went well - the group strategy and communication have allowed us to be less stressed at the start of the project. The backend went well in terms of getting set up, but was very difficult. We made a lot of progress getting the backend going.

What didn't go well - could have more participation from all group members.

What we got done - set up backend using MongoDB; made store, login, registration.

What we are doing next - work on incorporating the 3rd party API, connecting the frontend to the backend, set up the second view, set up store.

Week 2: 
What went well - continued group communication and pair programming has allowed us to keep going despite setbacks, redirecting upon setbacks and exploring alternate routes in order to stay on track, Rebekah coming back and using Gimp and other programs to photoshop and personalize our app, communication from Nathan that he will be working on Bootstrap over the next week to add design throughout our app, we did what we hoped we would do this week.

What didn't go well - errors early on with first API because it lacked documentation and was not user-friendly, unknown CORS issue.

What we got done - finished setting up components for front end, implemented 3rd party API, connected store to Login and to Registration, added review schema to back end, added all necessary endpoints (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), added reviews, added search functionality.

What we are doing next - make it so we can filter through both the 3rd party API and our database with one search so reviews will come up for items that get searched for, import our image to our front page/all pages?, icon on navbar for profile, profile component, profile schema, import bootstrap and designs, filter search results by movie/show/game, error handling with obvious 3rd party API bugs, deploy.
